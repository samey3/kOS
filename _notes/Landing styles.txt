Perhaps have another parameter in the ship configuration. This would specifiy the type of landing
the vessel uses. When it goes to land, checks the value, and selects from the appropriate landing
script.

It could then call suicideBurn.ks at the end of it (in starship case) and land.

Could be the same idea for launch scripts, which are likely to be more varied.
