PARAMETERS FOR BUILDER
-finalLocation (where the vehicle will move for the end of the script)
-vesselForPickup
-dropoffLocation (Have to stop a bit short so its dropped off in right spot)


ACTIONS
-move (this subscript takes two parameters, one is location, second is distance to stop from the location (default 0), e.g. move 100m nearby then run pickup script)
	* This one uses path-finding to get to the location. Calls intermediate-level move.
-pickUp (this script does not use path-finding, treats like flat ground, and picks up the specified object) - calls intermediate level pickUp
-dropOff (no path-finding, drops off the object at a specific location (orientation of drop-off?)) - calls intermediate level dropOff
-moveComponent (Moves to, pickup, move, dropOff, move if final destination set) - calls intermediate-level pickUp, move, dropOff

move(coordinates, standoffDistance)
pickUp(vessel)
dropOff(coordinates)		(Orientation?)
moveComponent(vessel, coordinates, (optional)coordinates)


BUILDING
RUNSCRIPT("build", "move", 0, 0, LATLNG(...)). //Ignores vesselPickup, dropOff location
RUNSCRIPT("build", "pickup", TARGET, 0, 0). //Ignores dropOff location, finalLocation
RUNSCRIPT("build", "dropoff", 0, LATLNG(...), 0). //Ignores dropOff location, finalLocation
RUNSCRIPT("build", "moveComponent", TARGET, LATLNG(...), LATLNG(...optional...)). //Ignores dropOff location, finalLocation
