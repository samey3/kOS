Hyperbolic double-transfer

Replace circular_maneuver during landing (Figure out a new method).
Time bound it like Lambert. Iterate along it.
At t + dt, R must be where the landing point will be.
OR IDEA
Target orbit will be a circular orbit at the geo-altitude (inc is latitude).
True anomaly is the longitude/whatever parameter it is (at t + dt)


IMPROVED
Current target longitude will be the true anomaly/whatever the parameter is
It will be a circular orbit along the surface
Lambert to intersect?
However this only works on circular orbits..

WORKS?
Define an inclined orbit.
