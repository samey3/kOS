With the checklist thing...

Each processing center should use the same scripts.

Self-requests are the way to go.

If it wants to launch a rocket, it will add requests to its own queue:
->Drive platform to some location (will return to requester after)
->Launch rocket (with 'some location' for booster landing site)

If it wats to drive a craft somewhere, it just sends a request to itself and lets the request
system handle it.
