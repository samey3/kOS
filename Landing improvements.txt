On first burn in atmosphere to reduce distance between desired and predicted landing locations,
Instead of facing complete retrograde of the current surface velocity, tilt it slightly so
it will experience no vertical acceleration (take into account Fg) and hold that vector.
This way, the vector direction will not move, and if needing to gain 'negative' horizontal
velocity to reach the target, it will be able to properly do it and not get stuck vertical.
