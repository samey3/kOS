Takes optional parameter (landing site/vessel)
On init, first clear the directory, then write a launch file containing booster target
Rocket will launch, and determine a point for the control to switch to booster (much preferably after payload has performed final burn?) (Preferably hold onto booster until apoapsis)
Booster will run a boot script (boosterBoot.ks) that will look for that file and get the parameters (else lands where it will impact)
Booster then runs land.ks with those parameters

BOOSTERBOOT
If not landed, splashed, height above terrain/ocean < 100,
get paremters
run land







Also launch/land idea:
Place a mobile platform at estimated landing site (e.g. on duna)
booster will land on it
return the rocket back to base, move another mobile platform to the landing site
fly/attach a new payload on top
