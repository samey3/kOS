Should maybe modify mod_velocity to run in different modes instead of creating a bunch of different ones?

Will define how differenceVector is set up.

E.g. All, plane, axis
Axis will work by taking in a vector as a parameter, and dotting it against everything.

Maybe axis and plane can have their own, as they use the body as the host object?
But that means you could use the original using the body.
What about surface vs orbital velocity, is that a problem?

With modAxis, can replace modTrajectory

Maybe make the 'mod' script calls the iterative ones? and have a master controller one?



StopAtVector.ks:
Run an iterative mod_trajectory or whatever inside the loops so it is constantly correcting.



ALSO
Need to make some sort of a modPos to maintain horizontal position on descent,
especially in-atmosphere



SUICIDE BURN LINE 29
_coordinates variable coming out of nowhere???





Can have a global variable 'currentScript' that is modified IMMEDIATELY upon a new script
being run. Can have an ON in a ship config or shipSystems.ks that waits for a change,
and does any appropriate staging/whatever.






Make a modified docking script to make use of the grabbing claw.
Make a bit for attaching it to others.
With this, add a tag to a docking port, e.g. '1'. The script will increment dock number
Find 1a, pick it up, attach to 1b. Increment and do 2. Keep going until done.
If no 1, check for 2s.. and so on until 20 or so.

For StopAtVector, only set throttle if req_accel > 0.9
Otherwise set to 0. Stops the gradual slowdown in favour of a fast one.
Also, make one that aligns heading to trajectory.
As such, only take the horizontal slowdown component of your thrust vector.
