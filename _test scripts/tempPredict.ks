//How this should work?
//Start at equator.

//We have:
// temperature at alt
// Can pre-record list of equilibrium temp at latitude
// Time-of-day temp variation (equator is +-4.5, is this constant for all latitudes?)

//Somehow apply this in a way to use the base curve (temp at alt), and combine it with the other two to predict temperature at a location
