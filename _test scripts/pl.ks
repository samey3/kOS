//Prefer recaculation of e.g. drag manually rather than requiring a lock, because that runs in background every tick, more than we need.
//Use velocity:surface for drag?

//Whats more efficient:
//Calculating dragF as a scalar and combining with retrograde vector?
//Or calculating it directly as a vector as currently?

//Does removing SHIP: from stuff make it faster?


//I suspect it has actually updated to a more realistic atmosphere though
//Remember we are using this to predict for an orbit we are not currently on, while in retrograde position.
//Thus can use current mass and what not?
