All major scripts will write to the same global variable upon start/finish and other spots, etc.
The system manager will have a section that loops over all parts and checks their tags.
Put all parts with the same tags in a list, and then puts all lists in a hash.

Upon global variable state change, check the new string.
If there exists an entry in the hash with that string, pull the list.
Stage/activate all the parts in the list.



^^^This won't work directly? Unless we only do the output in top level scriptsfor the most part.
Scripts that aren't run more than once, else that presents a problem.


Can use TWO global variables to uniquely identify all points.
Either one can be in the mission builder and one in the vessel-specific script, or put them both in vessel-specific?
