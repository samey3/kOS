Bad?
Remove changes from impactProperties


Instead, pass current orbit parameters and required impact location to Java program.
We can take advantage of the increased computation power, and check for each point in the orbit
what the delta-V is to impact at the location.
Thus we can use any orbit rather than iterating along a circular orbit.



Perhaps, some kind of data stream? One writes, one reads the same file, both update? Semaphore though,
can both open it at once? 
Allow main program to run while it waits for result, e.g. just by locking.
At a certain altitude where faster reaction is required, switch to non-atmo predictions which will
be relatively accurate by that time.
