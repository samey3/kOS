This one might be a mess.
This one refers to mobile set-up bases, not KSC or anything (that could be controlled by a master script).

Request new base component.
Move base component. -> Makes call to owned vehicles.
Manage base property.







How a base is started
 -> When command module landed and the base-manager boot script is run (On base land, script is moved to boot and run for first time),
	checks in data area for bases by vessel/base name (or id?), which contains several data areas.
 -> Data such as: array of ground-mover vehicles, air-mover vehicles, buildings, supplies landing area, base coordinates (usually command module)
 -> Master builder example: mission ops to land, create base


Base.lib
->Initialize/create base (creates file, adds the boot script)
->Load base data
->addVehicle(vehicle, type)
->moveBuilding/component(vessel, newLocation) (can move other vehicles I suppose)
	* Grabs the first vehicle appropriate for the job
	* Calls vehicle operations builder, strings together pickup, move, drop-off
->requestComponent (if valid naming scheme, go back to ksc, and load up the payload and launch it (FAR IN FUTURE)



Does this really need an operations folder? How else to properly do this?











Base ops also needs to be able to call mission ops (or master builder) and give coordinates for supplies to land.

2 parts:
Base boot script
Base lib (for support/simplify)

Boot script monitors things
-'resource tank component' not full/under some percent, pick a miner to go mine

(#1 TO IMPLEMENT)
Ground-vehicle operations:
-pickUp(vessel)
-dropOff(location)
-move(vessel, location)
* both make use of a 'transfer script', basically just driving to a location
Actions=pickUpComponent,dropOffComponent,moveComponent,move(calls just the basic move)
*all of the component scripts check if the vehicle has the proper equipment first
*else regular vehicles may only use the move script
*can drop off path-finding stuff in here

(#2 TO IMPLEMENT?)
Air-vertical-vehicle operations:
*same as ground-vehicle but adapted for vertical moving vehicles

~~Regular air vehicle operations will also have a similar set of actions
