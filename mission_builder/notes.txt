Used by the mission builder, basically just combines some scripts into a single script.
e.g. an example mission is:
	Transfer to sun
	Transfer to Duna
	Dock (match_rendezvous_dock.ks)

Can also have a landing script
	Circularize (at radius)
	Land (parameters from missionBuilder)


Can we set up certain global variables?
These would maybe define the end of the scripts, or can we just pass in as normal?
