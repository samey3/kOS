Due to how the missionBuilder works, there is no need to save the progress inside of one.
Simple call it upon rebooting, and it will figure out what is left.

May need to record on a vessel-specific script, e.g.

missionToVall
do some fuel transfers...
missionToKerbin

^^^Will need to save where in this script you are.
Can we make a lib/script for saving state? Or just follow a general structure and save
just a single string which tells it where to skip to.
