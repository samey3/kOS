Basically, just set a periapsis or apoapsis you want to end up at when transferring out

^^^Can use this for planetary transfer too, essentially the same script maybe?
Since you can predict what your time to periapsis will be upon exiting, perhaps using the patches too.

Set target altitude, will eject at proper side







REMEMBER TO FIX NODEBURN, RADIAL IS NORMAL, NORMAL IS RADIAL.

Remember, can use radial in and out during transfers to fine tune.
